Started working through the micro reddit client, working through things Test Driven and trying to implement as many best practices as I could from Blindside to try and make the app more standardized compared to how I've been writing things in the past. Doing things test first has definitely slowed me down but I know that it is really useful for me to learn like this for the future.
