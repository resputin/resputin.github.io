Back at The Odin Project again today but I moved on past the SQL I was doing yesterday and spent all moring working on [ActiveRecord](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/active-record-basics). I made it through the ActiveRecord rails guide, Migrations, and Validations over the course of about 3 hours. I still have one more section on associations left on this learning module and I wanted to approach it with a clear mind so I decided to stop for the day and start fresh with associations tomorrow since it is something that is a little more challenging for me to wrap my head around.
