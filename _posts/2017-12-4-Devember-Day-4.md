Today was my birthday! I spent the whole day at disneyland so instead of being able to be on my computer and work I watched the start of a video series that made friend made called [Blindside](https://www.blindside.io). It basically is walking through making a project in Rails from scratch from the perspective of an epxerienced dev talking through all of the things that he does. I watched the first two videos today, which started at registrations.
