After a long time away I've decided to pick back up on the programming journey with [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com). This is being motivated by the Devember movement that I found on r/learnprogramming. The goal of Devember is to spend at least one hour a day programming and then a short amount of time after that writing up the progress that was made everyday for the month of December. My goals are relatively simple for this month: Work through as much of the rails section of The Odin Project as I possibly can.

 Today I was working through the SQL section as a review and to get myself back up to speed so I can dive in to the meaty sections of The Odin Project over the next month. First up was [SQL Teaching](https://www.sqlteaching.com/) which was relatively easy until I got to multiple joins. After scratching my head with incorrect output for a while I started getting the general idea of multiple joins linking 3 tables together. After that I worked through [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) which was much more in depth and significantly slicker. I felt like SQL bolt was a great second resource because I wasn't so focused on learning the initial concepts but could spend more time on each lesson focusing on the things that it added as well as having a second chance to drill through everything from SQL Teaching. Overall I think it was a very solid first day and while I didn't spend any time in my editor I feel like it was the right amount of knowledge to get me started and hungry for more. See you tomorrow for day 2.
